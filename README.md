This project mainly focused on the students ability to use event listeners to make changes to the UI elements of the webpage. 

There were three main features that had to be implemented: 
1. Create a navigation meny dynamically using JavaScript
2. Set Active class dynamically with JavaScript to the menu item being clicked
3. Create the window.ScrollTo function for each individual menu items dynamically using JavaScript
4. Set another class dynamically to the nav menu while scrolling through each section of the page.
